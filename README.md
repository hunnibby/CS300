The projects involved creating a program to manage and display information about various courses. The main challenge was to handle data effectively: from loading course details from a file to sorting and displaying them in a user-friendly way. Understanding how different courses relate to each other through prerequisites was crucial, as it helped in structuring the program to show which courses need to be taken before others. To tackle these challenges, I approached the project step by step. First, I focused on setting up a system to read and store course information. Then, I implemented functions to sort and search through this data so that users could easily find specific courses or lists of related courses. Along the way, I learned the importance of using the right tools, like vectors for storing lists of courses and strings for handling text data, which made the program efficient and reliable. Throughout the project, I encountered some difficulties, like ensuring the program could handle different types of input files correctly and managing errors gracefully. Overall, this experience expanded my approach to designing software and writing programs that are easy to understand, maintain, and update as needed.
